# typing-race
A python written program that challenges you to type sentences, calculates your typing pace (word per minute) and shows your progression over time.

-get sentences on website (such as a random page on wikipedia), and selected if they fill the format conditions (length, no links or unknown characters).

-sentences stored in sql databases to retrieve them latter on

-the GUI runs with Tkinter, which might look a bit old, but works pretty fine for now (might change latter)

-a timer runs at every race, and also displays the word/minute ratio.

-a stats section will be implemented in order to show progression over time
